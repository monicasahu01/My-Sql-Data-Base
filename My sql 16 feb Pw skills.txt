
What is a database? Differentiate between SQL and NoSQL databases.

SQL databases are relational, and NoSQL databases are non-relational. 
SQL databases use structured query language (SQL) and have a predefined schema. 
NoSQL databases have dynamic schemas for unstructured data. SQL databases are vertically scalable, 
while NoSQL databases are horizontally scalable.
